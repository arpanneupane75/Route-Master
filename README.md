# 📍 Route Finder in the Topological Map of ERC

This project is a **campus navigation tool** developed using graph theory principles to find the shortest path between two locations on the ERC (Eastern Regional Campus) . It uses **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to compute optimal routes based on real-world distance measurements.

## 🚀 Features

* 📐 **Accurate Distance Mapping**: Collaborated with Civil Engineering students to measure real-world distances between points.
* 🌐 **Graph-Based Representation**: The campus is modeled as a graph with nodes and weighted edges.
* 🧠 **Shortest Path Finder**: Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the most efficient route between any two points.
* 🖼️ **Topological Map Integration**: Routes are visualized on the topological map of the campus.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* JFlutter/dart 
* Graph data structures
* Dijkstra’s algorithm


## 🗺️ How It Works

1. The campus map is divided into **nodes** (e.g., buildings, intersections).
2. **Edges** are assigned distances based on physical measurements.
3. Users select a **source** and **destination**.
4. The algorithm calculates the **shortest path** using Dijkstra’s logic.
5. The resulting path is displayed either as output or overlaid on the map.

## 🔧 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aansach/route-master.git
cd route-master
